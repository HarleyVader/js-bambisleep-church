# Remove Crawler Limits Task [100%]

## Objective
Remove all artificial limitations from the crawler to allow it to crawl all found sites without restrictions.

## Current Limitations Identified
1. **Link Processing Limit** - Currently limited to 20 links per crawl [100% FIXED]
   - Location: `src/mcp/agentKnowledge.js` line 962
   - Code: `const linksToProcess = relevantLinks;` (removed .slice(0, 20))

2. **Reddit Discovery Limit** - Currently limited to 10 most recent posts [100% FIXED]
   - Location: `src/mcp/agentKnowledge.js` line 692
   - Code: `for (const post of posts)` (removed .slice(0, 10))

3. **Rate Limiting** - Too aggressive delays between requests [100% OPTIMIZED]
   - Location: `src/mcp/tools/urlFetcher.js` lines 21-22
   - Code: `const limit = pLimit(3);` (increased from 1 to 3 concurrent)
   - Code: `const DELAY_BETWEEN_REQUESTS = 500;` (reduced from 2000ms to 500ms)

## Required Changes
1. Remove the `.slice(0, 20)` limitation in crawlAndExtractLinks function [100% COMPLETE]
2. Remove the `.slice(0, 10)` limitation in Reddit discovery function [100% COMPLETE]  
3. Increase concurrent request limit from 1 to reasonable number [100% COMPLETE]
4. Reduce delay between requests from 2000ms to more reasonable time [100% COMPLETE]

## Success Criteria
- Crawler processes ALL found links, not just first 20 [100% ACHIEVED]
- Reddit discovery processes ALL posts, not just first 10 [100% ACHIEVED]
- Improved crawling performance with reasonable rate limiting [100% ACHIEVED]
- No artificial limits preventing comprehensive site crawling [100% ACHIEVED]
