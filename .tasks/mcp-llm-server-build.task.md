# Task: Comprehensive Build for MCP Server/Agent with LLMs and Knowledge Base (Node.js, ES6, Express, Socket.IO, EJS)

## 1. Research & Documentation [100%]

- Download and review the full MCP documentation from [llms-full.txt](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt) [100%]
- Gather SDK docs (TypeScript or Node.js/ES6) and relevant READMEs [100%]
  - [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)
  - [Docs](https://deepwiki.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)
- Research best practices for Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, EJS, and MCP/LLM/knowledge base integration (security, transport, extensibility, etc.) [100%]

## 2. Specification & Planning [100%]

- Define all resources, tools, prompts, and external systems the MCP server/agent will expose or interact with [100%]
- Write a detailed specification for the use case, including knowledge base update flows, LLM integration, and security requirements [100%]
- Design the architecture: Node.js ES6, Express webserver, Socket.IO for real-time, EJS for templating, modular components, extensibility [100%]

# Specification (summary):
- Resources: Files, APIs, knowledge base documents, LLM completions (all with unique URIs)
- Tools: CRUD for knowledge base, echo, file listing, LLM-powered tools
- Prompts: Summarization, Q&A, workflow templates
- External: LLM API, file system, optional external APIs
- Flows: Users interact via web UI (EJS), Socket.IO for real-time, MCP protocol for agentic workflows; knowledge base updates via CRUD tools; LLM completions via MCP tool
- Security: OAuth 2.1, input validation, access control, encrypted transport
- Architecture: Node.js ES6, Express, Socket.IO, EJS, modular code, extensible components

## 3. Environment & Scaffolding [100%]

- Set up project structure and dependencies (Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, EJS, MCP SDK, etc.) [100%]
- Scaffold the Express webserver, Socket.IO, EJS views, MCP server, and knowledge base agent [100%]
- Create configuration files for environment, security, and transport [100%]

## 4. Core Implementation [100%]

- Implement MCP protocol: message exchange, error handling, and session management [100%]
- Build resource layer: expose files, APIs, and knowledge base as resources with unique URIs [100%]
- Implement tools: CRUD for knowledge base, echo, file listing, and LLM-powered tools [100%]
- Add prompt templates: summarization, Q&A, and workflow prompts [100%]
- Integrate LLM completions via `sampling/createMessage` [100%]
- Support client-suggested root URIs for resource scoping [100%]
- Implement streamable HTTP, stdio, and Socket.IO transports [100%]
- Render web UI with EJS for knowledge base and MCP interactions [100%]

## 5. Security & Compliance [100%]

- Implement secure authentication and authorization for all endpoints and Socket.IO events [100%]
- Use encryption for data in transit and at rest [100%]
- Validate all inputs and enforce access controls [100%]
- Regularly update and patch server dependencies [100%]
- Conduct a security audit and document findings [100%]

## 6. Testing & Debugging [100%]

- Write and run tests for all components (unit, integration, security) [100%]
- Test with MCP Inspector tool, web UI, and sample clients [100%]
- Add error handling, logging, and monitoring [100%]

## 7. Documentation & Delivery [100%]

- Document setup, usage, API endpoints, Socket.IO events, and security practices [100%]
- Provide usage examples and sample client scripts [100%]
- Commit code to version control and prepare release notes [100%]
