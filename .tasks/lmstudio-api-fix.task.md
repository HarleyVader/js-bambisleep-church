# LMStudio API Fix Task [0%]

## Problem Analysis

- Current auto-load uses wrong API endpoints (/v1/models/available, POST /v1/models/load)
- LMStudio logs show "Unexpected endpoint or method" errors
- Our axios-based approach conflicts with LMStudio's official SDK approach
- Need to use proper LMStudio TypeScript SDK or fix REST endpoints

## API Issues Found

1. GET /v1/models/available - doesn't exist (should be GET /v1/models for loaded)
2. POST /v1/models/load - not supported (should use SDK client.llm.load())
3. Need to check what REST endpoints LMStudio actually supports

## Solution Steps (MINIMAL APPROACH)

1. [100%] Remove incorrect /v1/models/available endpoint call - DONE
2. [100%] Remove failing POST /v1/models/load auto-load attempt - DONE
3. [100%] Keep only GET /v1/models for checking loaded models - DONE
4. [100%] Improve error handling and user messaging - DONE
5. [100%] Test fixed API calls - WORKING

## Files to Touch

- src/utils/lmstudio-manager.js (fix API calls)
- package.json (add SDK if needed)
