# Build Knowledgebase MCP Server & Core Agent

## Task Description

- Build a minimal MCP server for a knowledgebase. [100%]
- Implement a core Agent that crawls, analyzes, and adds URLs to the homepage link lists (index.ejs). [100%]
- Use only the necessary tools and files. [100%]
- Update the homepage to reflect new/updated URLs from the Agent. [100%]

## In-Depth Implementation Details

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server Design

- Integrate with LM Studio (0.3.6+) for tool use and structured output. [100%]
- Support OpenAI-compatible API for local LLMs (Qwen2.5, Llama-3.1, Ministral-8B, etc). [100%]
- Expose HTTP endpoints for knowledgebase operations (add, search, list, analyze, update, delete). [100%]
- Implement core tools:
  - `search_knowledge`: Semantic/keyword/hybrid search with filtering and limits. [100%]
  - `add_knowledge`: Add new entries with title, content, category, and metadata. [100%]
  - `analyze_context`: Analyze conversation context, extract entities, and suggest knowledge needs. [100%]
- Use structured output schemas for search results and knowledge entries. [100%]
- Provide tool execution handler for LM Studio function calling. [100%]
- Support caching, async operations, and error handling/fallbacks for robust performance. [100%]
- Enable health checks, metrics, and security (input validation, access control). [100%]

### Architecture & File Structure

- `src/mcp/McpServer.js`: Main MCP server entrypoint. [100%]
- `src/mcp/tools/`: Modular tools for search, management, and analysis. [100%]
- `src/mcp/resources/`: Document and vector resource handlers. [N/A]
- `src/mcp/prompts/`: Prompts for knowledge agent and search expert. [N/A]
- `src/lmstudio/`: LM Studio API client, tool executor, and response formatter. [100%]
- `src/knowledge/`: Storage, search, embeddings, and indexing logic. [100%]
- `config/`: Server and model configuration. [N/A]

### Example Tool Schemas

- All schemas implemented in code. [100%]

### Usage & Integration

- LM Studio integration and OpenAI-compatible API supported. [100%]
- Minimal, modular, and up-to-date as of June 14, 2025. [100%]

### Testing & Monitoring

- Minimal health checks and error handling present. [100%]
