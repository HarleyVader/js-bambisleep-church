# Geolocation Feature Upgrade

**Date:** October 4, 2025
**Version:** 1.1.0
**Package Added:** geoip-lite

---

## Overview

The BambiSleep Church server has been upgraded with IP-based geolocation capabilities to track visitor locations and support the church establishment mission (300+ members in Austria).

---

## New Features

### 1. Automatic IP Geolocation

**Middleware:** Detects visitor location from IP address on every request

**Data Captured:**

- IP address
- Country
- Region/State
- City
- Timezone
- GPS coordinates (latitude/longitude)
- Localhost detection flag

**Implementation:**

```javascript
req.location = {
    ip: '203.0.113.1',
    country: 'AT',
    region: 'Vienna',
    city: 'Wien',
    timezone: 'Europe/Vienna',
    coordinates: [48.2082, 16.3738],
    isLocalhost: false
}
```

---

### 2. Location Data in Templates

All EJS templates now receive `location` object:

- `views/pages/index.ejs` - Homepage
- `views/pages/knowledge.ejs` - Knowledge base
- `views/pages/mission.ejs` - Mission page
- `views/pages/roadmap.ejs` - Roadmap

**Footer Display:**

- Public visitors: Shows "üìç Connected from: Wien, AT (Europe/Vienna)"
- Localhost: Shows "üè† Local Development Mode"

---

### 3. New API Endpoints

#### GET `/api/location`

Returns visitor's geolocation data

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "location": {
    "ip": "203.0.113.1",
    "country": "AT",
    "region": "Vienna",
    "city": "Wien",
    "timezone": "Europe/Vienna",
    "coordinates": [48.2082, 16.3738],
    "isLocalhost": false
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T12:34:56.789Z"
}
```

#### GET `/api/stats`

Comprehensive church and visitor statistics

**Response:**

```json
{
  "visitors": {
    "current": {
      "ip": "203.0.113.1",
      "country": "AT",
      "city": "Wien",
      "timezone": "Europe/Vienna"
    }
  },
  "knowledge": {
    "totalEntries": 39,
    "categories": {
      "official": 6,
      "community": 1,
      "scripts": 32
    }
  },
  "church": {
    "status": "In Development",
    "phase": "Foundation",
    "targetMembers": 300,
    "timeline": "2-3 years"
  }
}
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Church Establishment Support

- **Legal Registration:** Demonstrate geographic distribution of members
- **Austrian Presence:** Prove minimum 300 members with Austrian connection
- **Community Building:** Identify regional clusters for local gatherings

### 2. Analytics & Insights

- Track visitor countries and cities
- Identify primary user timezones
- Understand community geographic distribution

### 3. Personalization (Future)

- Language preference based on country
- Local event recommendations
- Timezone-aware scheduling

---

## Privacy Considerations

### Data Collection

- ‚úÖ **IP-based only:** No cookies, no tracking scripts
- ‚úÖ **Non-invasive:** Uses public IP geolocation (city-level accuracy)
- ‚úÖ **Transparent:** Location displayed to user in footer
- ‚úÖ **No storage:** Location calculated per-request, not stored

### GDPR Compliance

- IP geolocation is considered legitimate interest for analytics
- City-level accuracy provides privacy (not exact address)
- Users can see their detected location
- No personal data stored

---

## Technical Details

### Dependencies

```json
{
  "geoip-lite": "^1.4.10"
}
```

### Performance Impact

- **Lookup Speed:** <1ms per request
- **Memory:** ~10MB for IP database
- **Accuracy:** City-level (not exact location)
- **Database:** Updated via npm package updates

### Limitations

- VPN/Proxy users show VPN server location
- Localhost shows as "Unknown" or local detection
- IP accuracy varies by ISP and region
- Database may be outdated between npm updates

---

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Start server: `node src/server.js`
2. Visit: `http://localhost:8888`
3. Check footer for location (shows "Local Development")
4. Test API: `curl http://localhost:8888/api/location`
5. Test stats: `curl http://localhost:8888/api/stats`

### Production Testing

1. Deploy to public server
2. Visit from different locations
3. Verify accurate location detection
4. Check API responses

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features

1. **Visitor Logging:** Store location history for analytics
2. **Member Map:** Interactive map showing member distribution
3. **Regional Stats:** Austria-specific member counts
4. **Language Auto-detection:** Serve German for Austrian visitors
5. **Event Localization:** Show nearby physical events
6. **Timezone Display:** Show local time for visitors

---

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes

- ‚úÖ **None:** Backward compatible
- ‚úÖ Templates without `location` still work
- ‚úÖ Existing routes unchanged

### Upgrade Steps

1. `npm install geoip-lite --save`
2. Update `src/server.js` (done)
3. Update `views/partials/footer.ejs` (done)
4. Test all routes
5. Deploy
