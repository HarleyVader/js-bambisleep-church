### Testing

- Basic integration test: `tests/mother-brain-chat-test.js`
- Full test suite: `tests/unified-test-suite.cjs`

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Chat Interface

```text
User: "mainframe info"
Response: Shows active users, recent messages, and available commands

User: "search for safety information"
Response: Searches database + broadcasts to community for peer support

User: "share finding https://example.com/resource"
Response: Shares with community + provides validation feedback
```

### MOTHER BRAIN Integration

```javascript
// Direct MOTHER BRAIN usage
const motherBrain = new MotherBrain();
await motherBrain.initialize();
const result = await motherBrain.crawlUrl('https://example.com');

// Through AgenticKnowledgeBuilder
const result = await agenticKnowledgeBuilder.crawlUrlWithMotherBrain(url);
```
