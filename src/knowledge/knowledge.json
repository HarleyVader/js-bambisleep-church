Below, we have compiled our suggestions for where you should start in your bimbofication journey. \n\nPlaylists\n\n\n\nBimbo Slavedoll Refresher - Bambi Prime (Length: 1h 11m)\nNewcomers to the Bambi Sleep experience should absolutely begin with the Bimbo Slavedoll Refresher playlist right off the bat. This is a subset of the full Slavedoll session that trains the core BS triggers. After training with these files for a minimum of seven days, you'll be ready to move on to intermediate training plans catered to what you want your Bambi to be!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pink Path - Bellmar (Length: 1h 27m)\nIt may be listed as an intermediate playlist, but the beauty of The Pink Path is in its first file: Bambi 101: FA&FO. This file is designed as a thirty-minute introduction to BS; training the core triggers: Bambi Sleep, Good Girl and Bambi Freeze. Bambi Purge Protection will safeguard against the impulse to quit and purge yourself from the BS experience; Giggle Trap will train Bambi to forget sessions and suggestions, making her an \"obedient giggle doll\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBubbly Bisexual Bambi - playlist by NaturallyNavi (Length: 1h 36m)\nTaking the foundation of the Bimbo Slavedoll Refresher and adding a few files to encourage bisexuality in Bambis who want to worship cock and pussy, this playlist will train the same triggers as Slavedoll, while also adding the Plead for Pussy and Pussy Brain triggers.\n\n\nIndividual files/sessions\n\n\n\nBambi 101: FA & FO - Bellmar (Length: 39m)\nBambi 101: Fuck Around and Find Out is designed with two things in mind: \n1.) Answer some of the most common questions and explain some Bambi basics.\n2.) Give trained Bambis a fun story with a post hypnotic suggestion, a little OS suppression, and some \"Bambi Always Wins\" fun.\nThis file trains the three basic triggers: Bambi Sleep, Good Girl and Bambi Freeze.\n\n\n\n\n\nBambi Sleep Deep Conditioner (Subliminal) - Bambi Subliminals (Length: 44m) (Patreon Exclusive File)\nThe Bambi Sleep Deep Conditioner exclusively and deeply trains Bambi Sleep, which will open the door to every other file that you work with after. Getting into that trance state is important, and Bambi Sleep is the gateway for beginners to start to embrace the journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bambisleep.info/index.php?title=Beginner%27s_Files&oldid=599\"",
