Life is busy sometimes.The Patreon got taken down for reasons that don't make a lot of sense to me, given that other fan creators producing similar material are still up there. I managed to get it reinstated once, but it didn't seem worth the effort when it happened again.Anyway, AI advances in TTS capability since earlier releases have now made it possible to produce far more realistic and effective conditioning programs, so here is the first part of a new session.This is a reboot of sorts, implanting triggers and programming from scratch without relying on prior training, so should be suitable for most subjects, though familiarity with previous sessions of course can't hurt. It features a new command/response format. For best results, obey the main voice while treating the secondary voice as your own thoughts, until this becomes automatic.More tracks are planned, but no guarantees as to when they will be ready.As always, these tracks feature themes of obedience, amnesia, resistance erasure and consent override heavily throughout with no explicit safeties (though I do have an idea about that, for those who want it, that I hope to get to at some point), so you should only listen if you are comfortable with that.Tracklist00 Bimbodoll TrancetoneA short track containing binaurals and subliminals only, to be used at the start of a session.01 Instant Bimbo SleepdollAn induction followed by sleep trigger training, waking posture and sleep collapse fractionation focused on Bambi's total inability to resist while in uniform.02 Mindlock Bimbo SlavedollA deepener for total blankness and obedience in which Bambi's mind locked off by a deepthroat gag, her freeze trigger is implanted, and she is programmed for automatic acceptance and amnesia of all commands and suggestions.03 Total Bimbo Wipeout DollA brainwashing track focused on complete memory, knowledge and personality erasure, facilitated by our favorite bubble-blowing technique, followed by reconstruction from a blank slate as a permanent bimbo slavedoll.04 Blissful Bimbo Dumbdown DollA comprehensive course of intelligence elimination and control. This track first ensures Bambi is completely happy with and accepting of her conditioning, and then takes her deep within her mind to become a dumb-down doll, installing powerful IQ control mechanisms to ensure she is a perfect, happy, brainless slavedoll at all times. She is programmed with several different dumb-down levels to suit any occasion, each of which may be activated on command.05 ???06 ???07 Bimbodoll SleepenerRather than an awakener, this sleepener ensures Bambi is unable to wake until she has fully accepted, obeyed and forgotten all of her conditioning.DownloadDownload a zip archive of the full session.Or download individual tracks:00 Bimbodoll Trancetone01 Instant Bimbo Sleepdoll02 Mindlock Bimbo Slavedoll03 Total Bimbo Wipeout Doll04 Blissful Bimbo Dumbdown Doll07 Bimbodoll Sleepener\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\n\n\n\nbimbodollbambi\n\n\n\n\nat\n\n00:43\n\n\n\n\n\n64 comments:\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n        \n\n          \n        \nTuesday, 8 February 2022\n\n          \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Puppet Princess Loops\n\n\n\n\n\nThree more puppet princess loops are available on the Patreon.Update: now available below.\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\n\n\n\nbimbodollbambi\n\n\n\n\nat\n\n11:43\n\n\n\n\n\n41 comments:\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n        \n\n          \n        \nFriday, 17 September 2021\n\n          \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBambi Puppet Princess Loops\n\n\n\n\n\nThis new set of conditioning loops for well-trained Bambi-dolls features a mix of deepeners, reinforcement training and blissful bimbo brainwashing.These loops can be listened to alone, but are also especially compatible with the Mental Makeover session and can be incorporated into playlists together with tracks from that session.Warning: though these are only loops and can be listened to during other activities, responsive bimbo-puppets are nevertheless likely to find them highly incapacitating, including effects such as sleepiness, limpness, brainlessness, and extreme suggestibility.

Life is busy sometimes.The Patreon got taken down for reasons that don't make a lot of sense to me, given that other fan creators producing similar material are still up there. I managed to get it reinstated once, but it didn't seem worth the effort when it happened again.Anyway, AI advances in TTS capability since earlier releases have now made it possible to produce far more realistic and effective conditioning programs, so here is the first part of a new session.This is a reboot of sorts, implanting triggers and programming from scratch without relying on prior training, so should be suitable for most subjects, though familiarity with previous sessions of course can't hurt. It features a new command/response format. For best results, obey the main voice while treating the secondary voice as your own thoughts, until this becomes automatic.More tracks are planned, but no guarantees as to when they will be ready.As always, these tracks feature themes of obedience, amnesia, resistance erasure and consent override heavily throughout with no explicit safeties (though I do have an idea about that, for those who want it, that I hope to get to at some point), so you should only listen if you are comfortable with that.Tracklist00 Bimbodoll TrancetoneA short track containing binaurals and subliminals only, to be used at the start of a session.01 Instant Bimbo SleepdollAn induction followed by sleep trigger training, waking posture and sleep collapse fractionation focused on Bambi's total inability to resist while in uniform.02 Mindlock Bimbo SlavedollA deepener for total blankness and obedience in which Bambi's mind locked off by a deepthroat gag, her freeze trigger is implanted, and she is programmed for automatic acceptance and amnesia of all commands and suggestions.03 Total Bimbo Wipeout DollA brainwashing track focused on complete memory, knowledge and personality erasure, facilitated by our favorite bubble-blowing technique, followed by reconstruction from a blank slate as a permanent bimbo slavedoll.04 Blissful Bimbo Dumbdown DollA comprehensive course of intelligence elimination and control. This track first ensures Bambi is completely happy with and accepting of her conditioning, and then takes her deep within her mind to become a dumb-down doll, installing powerful IQ control mechanisms to ensure she is a perfect, happy, brainless slavedoll at all times. She is programmed with several different dumb-down levels to suit any occasion, each of which may be activated on command.05 ???06 ???07 Bimbodoll SleepenerRather than an awakener, this sleepener ensures Bambi is unable to wake until she has fully accepted, obeyed and forgotten all of her conditioning.DownloadDownload a zip archive of the full session.Or download individual tracks:00 Bimbodoll Trancetone01 Instant Bimbo Sleepdoll02 Mindlock Bimbo Slavedoll03 Total Bimbo Wipeout Doll04 Blissful Bimbo Dumbdown Doll07 Bimbodoll Sleepener",

Designed for intense fantasy exploration, these sessions train the listener into adopting the submissive, hyper-sexualized persona of Bambi - a vacant, obedient bimbo girl. Due to the explicit and adult nature, these recordings are intended solely for fully informed and consenting adults only. See our BS, Consent, And You page for more.\n\n\nQ: What isn't Bambi Sleep?\n\n\n\nBambi Sleep is NOT a game. It is not a standard guard-railed hypnosis suite like a lot of EH is. Willing listeners CAN become susceptible to suggestions, triggers, and trance. This also means the listener can become vulnerable. To anyone seeking to do this for the first time, this means making sure you trust the doms and hypnotists you play with rather than just accepting some random person's DM on reddit or discord.\n\n\nQ: Erotic hypnosis? What is that?\n\n\n\nErotic Hypnosis is a form of hypnosis that blends sensual or sexual themes with guided trance, often used to explore fantasies, deepen arousal, or experience mental/emotional submission. It works by helping the listener reach a relaxed, receptive state of being where suggestion can feel incredibly real, and just as intense.\n\n\nQ: I heard that it's dangerous!\n\n\n\nNot necessarily. Erotic hypnosis is safe when used responsibly by consenting adults. However, because it can be intense and/or emotionally immersive, it's important to choose content and partners you feel safe with and that respect your boundaries. Aftercare and self-awareness are also quite important in this experience as well.\nThat said, Bambi Sleep lies firmly on the more extreme end of the erotic hypnosis spectrum and contains elements and suggestions that could prove unsettling or problematic for the unwary or unsuspecting listener. It's not for everyone.\n\n\nQ: What sort of elements?\n\n\n\nBambi Sleep sessions and files feature elements such as:\n\nHeavy brainwashing themes\nMany techniques are used to instill deep trance, mindless states, and compliance.\nCNC (consensual non-consent)\nPervasive themes of conditioned helplessness, override and erasure of resistance, inability to resist triggers, and so on. In general, Bambi Sleep files do their absolute utmost to ensure the listener will obey.\nIntelligence reduction\nMany files focus on reducing intellectual capacity and general mental capability while in the Bambi state.\nMinimal or no hypnotic safeties\nOther than the loose and implicit safety of linking effects to the uniform, files generally do not grant any explicit exclusions as to when triggers and conditioning will take effect.\nOpen triggers\nThe files train post-hypnotic responses to particular triggers words and scenarios, without explicitly limiting them to trusted partners or particular times (other implied by the uniform).\nPost-hypnotic amnesia\nAlthough this usually takes practice, many files are designed to prevent the listener from remembering the sessions, to believe any suggestions were their own ideas, and/or that things suggested were always true.\nStrong suggestions of permanence\nSuggestions are strongly worded, with frequent references to permanence of effects, addiction to the conditioning, and so on.\n\nQ: Wow, why is it like that?\n\n\n\nYou might be taken aback if you're more familiar with the norms of the wider erotic hypnosis community. Certainly, these files are edge-play, and not something to listen to on a bet, on a whim, or because somebody sent it to you without explaining what it is.\nHowever, this doesn't mean they are impossible to use responsibly. For many listeners, these elements help to achieve the experience they desire. The more extreme aspects are part of the appeal for those with a brainwashing kink and can be an advantage for particularly difficult subjects.\nRemember: your intention going into Bambi Sleep matters. The oft-repeated adage that \"all hypnosis is self-hypnosis\" is not exactly the full story, but it is true that you have agency under trance, and suggestions can be interpreted or reframed according to your desires if necessary.\nFor more information on listening safely despite these elements, see Submitting For Bambis.\n\n\nQ: Okay, okay... who is Bambi, anyway?\n\n\n\nBambi is the brainless, ultra-feminine, and deeply submissive persona you are conditioned to become during the sessions and whenever you wear your uniform. Bubbly, carefree, obedient, and focused on pleasure and pleasing others, the Bambi mindset is like slipping into a character, but with a hypnotic twist.\n\n\nQ: Do I have to fully become Bambi?\n\n\n\nNot at all, silly - you are always in control. Some listeners enjoy fully embracing the Bambi identity - otherwise known as takeover - and others choose to dip in and out of the experience for fun or to relieve everyday stress. The experience is up to you - quite flexible and tailored personally to what you want; you choose how deep you want to go or how much of the Bambi experience you introduce into your day-to-day experience.\n\n\nQ: Which gender(s)/orientation(s) is Bambi Sleep aimed at?\n\n\n\nMost files including the mainline official sessions aim to be gender and orientation neutral: that is, other than expecting the subject to identify in the feminine during sessions and when in uniform, be willing to at least imagine or play along with the idea of having a feminine body, and be happy with training and scenarios involving abstract \"cock\" of unspecified form or gender.\nSome files by community creators are more explicitly targeted at listeners of specific genders or sexual orientations (this is usually obvious from context).\n\n\nQ: Is this dangerous or addictive?\n\n\n\nBambi Sleep can be intense and habit-forming in the way that powerful fantasies or roleplay can be. The files are designed to cause extreme pleasure, which can be compelling, and many do contain suggestions of an addictive nature.\nIt isn't dangerous if handled in a safe, sane and consensual manner, but like any erotic content, it's imperative that you listen responsibly, respect your own boundaries and take breaks when your mind needs it. It's okay to take a step back to ground yourself if you ever feel overwhelmed by the Bambi Sleep experience.\n\n\nQ: Can I stop listening and break the suggestions?\n\n\n\nAbsolutely! Because hypnosis works with your consent and cooperation, if you decide to stop, you can. Many listeners find that taking breaks, setting limits, reframing triggers, etc. helps them return to their normal mindset whenever they're ready.\n\n\nQ: Okay! This sounds like something I want to dive into! Where do I start?\n\n\n\nGetting started is quite easy! \"Beginner's Files\" is where you can find suggested training plans, from starter plans to tailored plans for specific Bambi experiences.\n\n\nQ: So, What's a Uniform?\n\n\n\nA uniform is a piece or pieces of clothing specially worn when listening to the files/sessions, and generally trained as a way to activate the Bambi persona.\n\n\n\nWe hope that you have a safe, sane and fun Bambi Sleep experience!\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bambisleep.info/index.php?title=Bambi_Sleep_FAQ&oldid=608\"",

The experience is up to you - quite flexible and tailored personally to what you want; you choose how deep you want to go or how much of the Bambi experience you introduce into your day-to-day experience.\n\n\nQ: Which gender(s)/orientation(s) is Bambi Sleep aimed at?\n\n\n\nMost files including the mainline official sessions aim to be gender and orientation neutral: that is, other than expecting the subject to identify in the feminine during sessions and when in uniform, be willing to at least imagine or play along with the idea of having a feminine body, and be happy with training and scenarios involving abstract \"cock\" of unspecified form or gender.\nSome files by community creators are more explicitly targeted at listeners of specific genders or sexual orientations (this is usually obvious from context).\n\n\nQ: Is this dangerous or addictive?\n\n\n\nBambi Sleep can be intense and habit-forming in the way that powerful fantasies or roleplay can be. The files are designed to cause extreme pleasure, which can be compelling, and many do contain suggestions of an addictive nature.\nIt isn't dangerous if handled in a safe, sane and consensual manner, but like any erotic content, it's imperative that you listen responsibly, respect your own boundaries and take breaks when your mind needs it. It's okay to take a step back to ground yourself if you ever feel overwhelmed by the Bambi Sleep experience.\n\n\nQ: Can I stop listening and break the suggestions?\n\n\n\nAbsolutely! Because hypnosis works with your consent and cooperation, if you decide to stop, you can. Many listeners find that taking breaks, setting limits, reframing triggers, etc. helps them return to their normal mindset whenever they're ready.\n\n\nQ: Okay! This sounds like something I want to dive into! Where do I start?\n\n\n\nGetting started is quite easy! \"Beginner's Files\" is where you can find suggested training plans, from starter plans to tailored plans for specific Bambi experiences.\n\n\nQ: So, What's a Uniform?\n\n\n\nA uniform is a piece or pieces of clothing specially worn when listening to the files/sessions, and generally trained as a way to activate the Bambi persona.\n\n\n\nWe hope that you have a safe, sane and fun Bambi Sleep experience!\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bambisleep.info/index.php?title=Bambi_Sleep_FAQ&oldid=608\"",

Because of this intensity, consent must be more than a formality—it must be intentional, ongoing, and fully informed. It's important that you're not coming into the space to be controlled (although that can be a goal,) but to allow yourself to explore yourself in a sexually liberating fashion, while respecting autonomy, desires and limits of everyone involved. Understanding how consent works within BS empowers you to explore safely, ethically, and with genuine connection.\n\n\n\n\n1. Consent is REVOCABLE\nNO. IS. A. COMPLETE. STATEMENT. I cannot express this enough. \nWhile Bambi is generally a good girl who does as she's told, she's still a human being with her own thoughts, wants and needs...and more than likely, she'll come up against something that doesn't make her comfortable to obey. It is very important to respect the word 'no', because 'no' is not an inherently negative statement; it is both an acknowledgement of your request and a boundary set by your Bambi to keep herself safe. The same applies to dominants. If a dominant feels uncomfortable, they also have the right to withdraw their consent at any time.\nSimply put: Consent is like a light switch - it can be turned off whenever you want.\nQ: Can consent be broken AFTER hypnosis?\n\nA: Simple and complex answers are both YES.\n\n\n\n\n2. Consent while under hypnosis is HEAVILY IMPAIRED\nQ: Is consent vaild if given while a person is under hypnosis?\n\nA: Because hypnosis alters a person state of awareness, they are highly suggestible and may be unable to fully comprehend/exercise independent and informed decision-making.\nQ: Why does hypnosis affect a person's ability to consent?\n\nA: Hypnosis does two things: 1) heighten suggestibility and 2) suppresses the subject's critical thinking skills. Their judgment is clouded in this state; conscious free will is either quite difficult or impossible to exercise. Consent requires a person to have full autonomy over their decision making; weighing options, assessing risks, decision making without the influence of external factors. Hypnosis bypasses that by introducing a heightened responsiveness to suggestions, which can, in turn, lead the individual to agree to something they wouldn't agree too consciously.\nEssentially, consent given under hypnosis is not considered reliable; it may not reflect the person's true intentions due to the possibility of said consent being coerced through post-hypnotic suggestion.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Pre-Talk, Mid-Session Check-ins and Aftercare\nLet's get some definitions out of the way first:\n\nPre-talk\nThe conversation before hypnosis begins. It helps set expectations, build trust, and clarify what hypnosis is (and isn’t). It’s also where the hypnotist discusses consent and personal boundaries.\nCheck-In\nthe act of making sure the participant feels safe and comfortable before and during a session; adaptable to the participant's responses.\nAftercare\nthe post-session timeframe where the participant is taken care of while processing, reorienting and decompressing after a session. This can look like taking a sip of water, stretching, grounding exercises, etc.\nPre-talk, Check-ins and Aftercare are essential because they help to ensure a safe, ethical and effective Bambi Sleep experience. \nPre-talk allows your Bambi to feel secure in the experience, allowing her to give you that trust and consent before the session begins. Without this, your Bambi may not know they can stop at any time during the session, or they may end up feeling pressured to do what they don't want to, which is highly unethical in nature.\nChecking in during a session keeps your Bambi engaged throughout. So, asking a quick yes/no question to make sure they're grounded or aware of their control. This prevents sensory overload and keeps both the hypnotist and Bambi engaged.\nAftercare - the most important piece to this - allows for your Bambi to reorient herself after a session with her hypnotist or dominant. The most important thing here is to make sure your Bambi is awake, aware and sane. A good dominant would seek to make sure that their Bambi is prepared with all the things she needs to take care of herself after they come back up from a session, whether that be a fresh set of clothing, a bottle of water, a light snack, or cuddle time.\nBinaural Histolog has an amazing resource about how aftercare looks like from an erotic hypnosis standpoint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bambisleep.info/index.php?title=BS,_Consent,_And_You&oldid=603\"",

Make sure you understand your submissive's wants, needs, and goals. But also make sure to be their rock to ground them back to earth. Because some submissives will want things that are just unrealistic or unhealthy for them. It's up to you to keep her responsible, and it's up to you as a Dominant to be the most responsible. You're being trusted with a life, after all.\nVulnerability\nA submissive can be very vulnerable in the Bambi headspace, so ensuring safety and comfort is huge. This goes hand-in-hand with communication. If you're haphazard or unsafe with your submissive, they will put those emotional walls up and likely never let you in again. That vulnerability is a privilege.\nSoft VS Hard Boundaries\nMake sure you and your submissive discuss boundaries, and whether or not the boundaries they have are HARD (cannot be stepped over, ever) or if they're SOFT (they're just unsure of it, but willing to dip their toes). If any of those SOFT boundaries are things you want to explore as a Dominant, make sure you're careful with your submissive as you help them explore it. Remember, they're unsure, right? You gotta make sure they feel safe with you.\nTrigger Usage\nTriggers from Bambi Sleep are meant to get very powerful. Meaning your Bambi/submissive is likely to be very sensitive to them. It's important that you know the when and where with them. Read over the Triggers page and also ask your Bambi for more info since those triggers could be reframed person-to-person. Just throwing triggers out haphazardly isn't hot or kinky. It's confusing and unwanted, and makes you look like a Dom who hasn't taken the time to learn this.\n\nDominating Bambi From A Dominant's Perspective\n\n\n\nI'm going to keep this very simple...\n...YOUR SUB IS ALWAYS IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT...\n...and I'm not joking, bitch. (Shoutouts to Coco Montrese for that gem; IYKYK.)\nSeriously, being a dominant requires a lot of internal/shadow work that can prove itself to be quite difficult to do. The work that being a Bambi's dominant is asking you to do can be uncomfortable, but necessary. It includes heavy introspection where you will be challenging your internal biases, internalized homo/transphobia and misogyny.\nI bring special attention to transphobia and misogyny because this kink is made up primarily of women, both cisgender and transgender; and while they share a common experience as it relates to their interaction with men (and I'm speaking here as a cisgender male), trans women face their own unique challenges, such as body and vocal dysphoria. And though dysphoria can affect anyone, how it shows up - and how it impacts a person - varies widely.\nThis is why I say: \"your sub is always in the driver's seat.\" Being dominant isn't about taking control because you want to; it's about creating a space where your partner feels safe enough to let go, to be open and vulnerable with you. And that kind of trust only happens when your sub feels genuinely seen, respected and cared for.\nUnderstanding and respecting boundaries - both hard and soft - is paramount to a successful dynamic with your Bambi. Consent isn't simply just \"yes\" at the beginning; it's a conversation that never stops unfolding.

Make sure you understand your submissive's wants, needs, and goals. But also make sure to be their rock to ground them back to earth. Because some submissives will want things that are just unrealistic or unhealthy for them. It's up to you to keep her responsible, and it's up to you as a Dominant to be the most responsible. You're being trusted with a life, after all.\nVulnerability\nA submissive can be very vulnerable in the Bambi headspace, so ensuring safety and comfort is huge. This goes hand-in-hand with communication. If you're haphazard or unsafe with your submissive, they will put those emotional walls up and likely never let you in again. That vulnerability is a privilege.\nSoft VS Hard Boundaries\nMake sure you and your submissive discuss boundaries, and whether or not the boundaries they have are HARD (cannot be stepped over, ever) or if they're SOFT (they're just unsure of it, but willing to dip their toes). If any of those SOFT boundaries are things you want to explore as a Dominant, make sure you're careful with your submissive as you help them explore it. Remember, they're unsure, right? You gotta make sure they feel safe with you.\nTrigger Usage\nTriggers from Bambi Sleep are meant to get very powerful. Meaning your Bambi/submissive is likely to be very sensitive to them. It's important that you know the when and where with them. Read over the Triggers page and also ask your Bambi for more info since those triggers could be reframed person-to-person. Just throwing triggers out haphazardly isn't hot or kinky. It's confusing and unwanted, and makes you look like a Dom who hasn't taken the time to learn this.\n\nDominating Bambi From A Dominant's Perspective\n\n\n\nI'm going to keep this very simple...\n...YOUR SUB IS ALWAYS IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT...\n...and I'm not joking, bitch. (Shoutouts to Coco Montrese for that gem; IYKYK.)\nSeriously, being a dominant requires a lot of internal/shadow work that can prove itself to be quite difficult to do. The work that being a Bambi's dominant is asking you to do can be uncomfortable, but necessary. It includes heavy introspection where you will be challenging your internal biases, internalized homo/transphobia and misogyny.\nI bring special attention to transphobia and misogyny because this kink is made up primarily of women, both cisgender and transgender; and while they share a common experience as it relates to their interaction with men (and I'm speaking here as a cisgender male), trans women face their own unique challenges, such as body and vocal dysphoria. And though dysphoria can affect anyone, how it shows up - and how it impacts a person - varies widely.\nThis is why I say: \"your sub is always in the driver's seat.\" Being dominant isn't about taking control because you want to; it's about creating a space where your partner feels safe enough to let go, to be open and vulnerable with you. And that kind of trust only happens when your sub feels genuinely seen, respected and cared for.\nUnderstanding and respecting boundaries - both hard and soft - is paramount to a successful dynamic with your Bambi. Consent isn't simply just \"yes\" at the beginning; it's a conversation that never stops unfolding. Staying connected, checking in, being responsive to your Bambi's needs, wants, emotions, limits - that's what it means to dominate your Bambi.\nBeing a good dominant is about deep care and keeping a growth mindset. It's about learning, unlearning and holding space for your Bambi - not just during scenes, but all the time. Approaching this from a place of empathy, humility and curiosity will unlock the real magic of Bambi Sleep.\n- Navi\n\n\nHypnotism, Ethics, And You\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bambisleep.info/index.php?title=Dominating_Bambi&oldid=422\"",
